1. Set Up Your .gitlab-ci.yml
Ensure your repository has the .gitlab-ci.yml file with the jobs and rules: as described.

2. Push to Different Branches
Push to main branch:

Commit a change and push to the main branch.
Expected: Both build and publish jobs should run (since their rules match main on push).
Push to a feature branch:
Create a branch, e.g., feature/test.
Commit and push.
Expected: Neither job will run (unless you add rules to allow it).

3. Open a Merge Request
Create a merge request (MR) from your feature branch into main.
Expected: The build job should run (rules: for MR event), but the publish job should NOT run (since its rule is only for direct pushes to main).
